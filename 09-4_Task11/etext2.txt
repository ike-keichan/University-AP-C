The Department of Intelligent Systems particularly stands out for
giving students the unique opportunity to study and design a
human-centered and user-friendly computer system.  The study includes
brain science which explores human characteristics, as well as
information processing which examines the field of mechatronics, the
combination of mechanical and electrical engineering.  In the
Department of Computer Science, students learn cutting-edge science
and technologies which support the advanced information society such
as hardware, software and network systems, and at the same time
nurture the ability to develop the systems useful for solving human
and social problems.  The Department of Network Media provides students
with knowledge and skills related to networks including Internet and
LAN, and also fosters students' practical ability to develop new
information network technologies, such as the popular video portal
site, "YouTube", and the social networking site, "mixi".  Such skills
are essential in today's increasingly global society.

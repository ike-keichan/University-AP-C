The Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering recruits new students
collectively as opposed to separately for each department.  In the
first year through the first semester of the second year, students
study mathematics, physics and programming skills, which are the base
of information technology, as Common Basic Subjects across the
departments.  In the second semester of the second year, students
choose one of the three departments in line with their interests and
aptitude, approaching a further specialized field. 

Another characteristic of this faculty is its well-developed education
system with a high number of full-time instructors - 30 in
total.  Special Research (Graduation Research), which starts in the
second semester of the third year, is a small-sized class of five or
six students, which flexibly responds to each thesis theme according
to students' desires and interests.  Additionally, courses related to
programming are consistently offered from the first year through the
second semester of the third year.  Project Exercise is offered as a
laboratory subject, which provides students with an opportunity to
experience a teamwork activity required in the real world.  A wide
variety of such laboratory and practical training subjects aim to
develop the necessary workplace and communication skills of tomorrow's
engineers and researchers.
